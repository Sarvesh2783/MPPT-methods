MPPT Methods using MATLAB Simulations
Overview
This repository contains MATLAB simulation models for various Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) methods, specifically Perturb and Observe (P&O) and Incremental Conductance. These models are designed to optimize the power output from solar panels by dynamically adjusting the operating point to the maximum power point under varying environmental conditions.
Features
Perturb and Observe (P&O) Algorithm: A simple and widely-used MPPT technique that perturbs the operating voltage and observes the change in power to find the maximum power point.
Incremental Conductance Algorithm: A more precise MPPT method that calculates the derivative of the power with respect to voltage and adjusts the operating point accordingly
